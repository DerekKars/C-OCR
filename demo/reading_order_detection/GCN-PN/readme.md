# GCN-PN

This code repository contains the our re-implementations of the method 
[GCN-PN](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123700086.pdf)
 (ECCV2020).

## Train From Scratch

If you want to train the model from scratch, please following these steps:

1.Firstly, prepare the dataset and datalist follows [`demo/reading_order_detection/datalist/DI/readme.md`](../datalist/DI/readme.md) 

2.Secondly, prepare the pretrained models from model_zoo of mmdetection:

-   *resnext101_64*x4d-ee2c6f71.pth

3.Thirdly, direct run `demo/reading_order_detection/GCN-PN/train.sh`

## Test

Given the trained model, direct run `demo/reading_order_detection/GCN-PN/test.sh` to test model.

## Trained Model Download

For the released data is a subset, which smaller than paper reported. So the results might be slightly different from reported results. Moreover, paper takes sinkhorn method into training phase and get some improvements, but it works less in our implementation. Thus, we only release the base model. 

Results on DI datasets and trained models are follows:

|   total_order_acc   | DI_whole | DI_subset | Links       |
| :---------:        | :------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| GCN-PN (report) |  79   |    -       | -   |
| GCN-PN   |  -    |   72.23   | [config](config/gcn_pn_di.py), [pth](https://drive.hikvision.com/hcs/controller/hik-manage/fileDownload?link=wLuBfaGi) (Access Codeï¼šQDHU) |
