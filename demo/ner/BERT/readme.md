# BERT+CRF

This code repository contains the implementations of the method BERT+Softmax/Span/CRF. The Original BERT (NAACL-HLT, 2019) paper can be found in [link](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/n19-1423)


## Train From Scratch

If you want to train the model from scratch, please following these steps:

1.Firstly, prepare the pretrained models:

-  [bert-base-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased)
-  [bert-base-chinese](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese)

2.Secondly, modify the paths in model config (`demo/ner/BERT/bert_softmax(span/crf).py`), including the pretrained models paths, datasets paths, work space, etc. 

3.Thirdly, direct run `demo/ner/BERT/dist_train.sh`.

## Test

Given the trained model, direct run `demo/ner/BERT/test.sh` to test model.

## Trained Model Download

All of the models are re-implemented and well trained based on the opensourced framework mmdetection. So, the results might be slightly different from reported results.

Results on various datasets and trained models can be download as follows:
