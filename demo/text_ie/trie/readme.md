# TRIE

This code repository contains the implementations of the paper [TRIE: End-to-End Text Reading and Information Extraction for Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13118.pdf) (ACM MM20).


## Preparing Dataset
- SROIE: Dataset used for [ICDAR2019-SROIE](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=13) competition. Since this dataset contains many annotation errors, we will clean this dataset later and release corresponding trained model soon.
- Wildreceipt: Original dataset can be downloaded from [MMOCR](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr). Formatted training datalist and vocab used can be found in demo/text_ie/datalist.

## Train From Scratch
Temporarily, we release pretrained model on Wildreceipt dataset using detection and recognition ground-truth, more trained models on diverse datasets will be published soon.

If you want to re-implement the model's performance from scratch, please following these steps:

1.Firstly, download original dataset and unzip it to demo/text_ie/datalist.

2.Secondly, modify the dataset, word dir and pretrained resnet50 model path in `demo/text_ie/trie/config/wildreceipt_gt_trie.py`.

3.Thirdly, direct run `demo/text_ie/trie/dist_train.sh`.

> We provide the implementation of online validation

## Test

Given the trained model, direct run `demo/text_ie/trie/test.sh` to inference model.

## Trained Model Download

All of the models are re-implemented and well trained based on the opensourced framework mmdetection. So, the results might be slightly different from reported results.

Results on various datasets and trained models can be download as follows:

|   Dataset   | Backbone | Pretrained | Train Scale | Test Scale | F1-score | Links |
| :---------: | :------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :------: | :---: |
| Wildreceipt | ResNet50 |  ImageNet  | (512, 512)  | (512, 512) |  87.08   |  [config](./configs/wildreceipt_gt_trie.py), [pth](https://drive.hikvision.com/hcs/controller/hik-manage/fileDownload?link=gFcV3D3g) (Access Code:6xq7)     |
