# EAST

This code repository contains an implementation of EAST Text detector. [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03155v2.pdf) (CVPR 2017).

## Preparing Dataset
Original images can be downloaded from: [ICDAR2015](https://github.com/?ch=4).

The formatted training datalist and test datalist can be found in `demo/text_detection/datalist/`

## Training
Modified the paths ("imgs"/ "pretrained_model"/ "work_space", etc.) in the config files `demo/text_detection/east/config/east_r50_rbox.py`.

Run the following bash command in the command line,
``` shell
cd $DAVAR_LAB_OCR_ROOT$/demo/text_detection/east/
bash dist_train.sh
```

> We provide the implementation of online validation. If you want to close it to save training time, you may modify the startup script to add `--no-validate` command.

## Offline Inference and Evaluation
We provide a demo of forward inference and visualization. You can modify the paths (`test_dataset`, `image_prefix`, etc.) in the testing script, and start testing:
``` shell
python test.py 
```
Some visualization of detection results are shown:

![./vis/img628.jpg](./vis/img_357.jpg)
![./vis/img1099.jpg](./vis/img_336.jpg)

### Offline Evaluation

The general evaluation tool can be found in [`davarocr/demo/text_detection/evaluation/`](../evalution/).

## Trained Model Download
All of the models are re-implemented and well trained in the based on the opensourced framework mmdetection.
