# Text Perceptron Detector

This code repository contains the implementations of the paper [Text Perceptron: Towards End-to-End Arbitrary-Shaped Text Spotting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06820.pdf) (AAAI 2020).

> This repository only contains the detection part of Text Perceptron. For the entire end-to-end implementation, please going to [Text Perceptron Spot](../../text_spotting/text_perceptron_spot)


## Preparing Dataset
Original images can be downloaded from: [Total-Text](https://github.com/cs-chan/Total-Text-Dataset "Total-Text") , [SCUT-CTW1500](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/Curve-Text-Detector).

The formatted training datalist and test datalist can be found in `demo/text_detection/datalist/`

## Training
Modified the paths of "imgs"/ "pretrained_model"/ "work_space" in the config files `demo/text_detection/text_perceptron_det/config/tp_r50_3stages_enlarge.py`.

Run the following bash command in the command line,
``` shell
cd $DAVAR_LAB_OCR_ROOT$/demo/text_detection/text_perceptron_det/
bash dist_train.sh
```

> We provide the implementation of online validation. If you want to close it to save training time, you may modify the startup script to add `--no-validate` command.

## Offline Inference and Evaluation
We provide a demo of forward inference and visualization. You can modify the paths (`test_dataset`, `image_prefix`, etc.) in the testing script, and start testing:
``` shell
python test.py 
```
Some visualization of detection results are shown:

### Offline Evaluation

The offline evaluation tool can be found in [`davarocr/demo/text_detection/evaluation/`](../evalution/).

## Trained Model Download
All of the models are re-implemented and well trained in the based on the opensourced framework mmdetection. So, the results might be slightly different from reported results.

Results on various datasets and trained models download:

> The original SCUT-CTW1500 was released to only support text detection task, where all text instances are considered. When this dataset was used in text spotting task, some instances (blurred or in other languages) were labeled as not care.
